Django Hybrid Storage
====================

Use multiple file storages to serve and store file.

This project is based on work by Andrew Ingram. Thanks Andrew!


## Installation

    pip install django-hybridstorage

## Usage

Update your `settings.py`:

```python
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'hybridstorage.storages.HybridStorage'
HYBRID_STORAGE_BACKENDS = (
    'django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage',
    'my_project.s3utils.MediaRootS3BotoStorage',
)
```

In this example `MediaRootS3BotoStorage` is derivered from `django-storages`'s `storages.backends.s3boto.S3BotoStorage` class. See http://stackoverflow.com/a/10825691

Hybridstorage iterates `HYBRID_STORAGE_BACKENDS` until desired IO operation completes successfully.

**Note:** File removal operation is disabled to prevent accidental deletions!
